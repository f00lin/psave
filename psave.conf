# Configuration file for psave power-management scripts
#
#
# psave is split into individual scripts, or modules, that each control
# one aspect of power management
#
#
# Each psave module has at least three configuration options: 
#
# (1) A true/false switch which enables/disables the module 
#
# (2) A setting to be used in situations where saving power is priority 
#
# (3) A setting to be used in situations where performance is priority.  
#
#
# In addition, many modules have a path specified.  Most should work
# in the majority of cases, and may be left unaltered  But some of the 
# default paths might/will vary between systems.  It has been indicated
# when this is most likely.
#
#
# This config file has a set of sane(ish) defaults for each module, many  
# of which I use myself.  These are commented out and take effect once 
# you have enabled the module.  To change from the default simply 
# uncomment a setting and alter as desired.    When first installed, all 
# the modules are *disabled by default*.  This is to allow individual users
# to select which modules/settings are appropriate for their system.  
#
# It cannot be stressed too much that the responsibility for configuring
# psave lies with YOU, the user.  Many psave modules write to
# the /proc and /sys virtual file systems, specifying an invalid setting
# can therefore be dangerous and lead to an unstable system.  
#





# psave modules are divided into two groups:
#
# *CORE* 
#
# Should work on most linux systems with the default settings, and no
# configuration.  Obviously, they can be configured if desired.
#
#
# *EXTRA*
# 
# May require greater configuration for your particular system,
# the installation of some optional dependencies, or the editing of certain
# paths.  Otherwise they may only be applicable to certain systems, 
# for example netbooks or a subset of, say, intel-based devices.

#
# VIRTUAL_MEMORY
#
# Control various aspects of how aggressive the system is in trying to
# avoid writing data to disk.  Less disk I/O activity = less power used.  
#
# Details for the settings:
#
# VM_LAPTOP_MODE:
#   Allows HDDs to spin down by grouping disk write activity into chunks
#   that are spaced at longer intervals, rather than continual low-level
#   I/O activity.  More specifically, disk write activity is co-ordianted
#   with disk read activity to prevent subsequent unnecessary spin-ups.
#   The figure entered here is the time (in seconds) between disk I/O
#   activity and the flushing of dirty blocks to be written to disk.
#   0=disabled.
#
# VM_DIRTY_RATIO
#   When apps write data to disk, this data isn't written out to 
#   the disk straight away, but is written to system memory (RAM). The    
#   kernel then decides when and how that data is going to be written to
#   disk.  This setting controls the percentage of system memory that is
#   available for caching.  Once this limit is reached all writes will
#   go directly to disk until we fall under this ratio.   
#
# VM_DIRTY_BACKGROUND_RATIO
#   See DIRTY_RATIO, above.  This setting controls the
#   percentage of system memory that can be used to cache data waiting to
#   be written to disk.  Once this limit is reached, the kernel will
#   begin writing the cached data to disk.
#
# VM_DIRTY_WRITEBACK_CENTISECS
#   The time (in centiseconds) between wake-ups of the pdflush
#   writeback daemon, which writes old data out to disk.  
#   i. e. the time after which the daemon will wake and start flushing  
#   data to disk regardless of whether the two ratios above have been 
#   reached.

#   Controls the timeout before the HDD spins down in order to save power.
#   The values for this are somewhat insane (see man hdpram for the full

# HARDDRIVES_POWER_MGMT
#   Advanced power management setting.  The lower the figure the more aggressive

#   potential to shorten the life of your drive.  0 is the most aggressive power saving
